# Finances
This repository is for both the Android app and the Spring backend of the personal finances management project I'm developing for college.

Besides the app and backend, there will be the project itself and the diagrams (both written in Portuguese) that I needed to develop for this class.

The diagrams contain, one Use Case diagram, one Class diagram, and six Sequence diagrams. 
The diagrams were made using StarUml, so to open them you'll need the software.
